# Delving_Delicaties_Jam2022
Code for 2-week long game jam during done after studies.

typo in repos name, The Project, "Delving Delicacies" was made for Weight gaming's 2022 game jam.
The end result is available to download, but be warned that the game jam was hosted by a fetish community if you do decide to partake into any content from Weight gaming's game jam. 

Other than that, the experience alone from partaking into the game jam is gratifying as I get to learn how to better prototype and manage a multi-disciplinary team.
The game was a small dungeon crawling twinstik shooter in which I further practiced with my observer design pattern and further work into producing a better modularity for behaviour script in order to better mix and match them.

I also had to develop some tools and documentation for my artist due to a period of time toward the end of the game jam in order to help them with the intregration of content and creation of cutscene in unity while I was away. 

A wonderful experience where I got to push myself and see how well I did compared to my past selves :D

Link to the forum post presenting the game (BE WARNED THAT THIS IS A NSFW COMMUNITY, I suggest staying within the game jam section if anything, just in case.)
